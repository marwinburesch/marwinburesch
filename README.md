## üê∏ good morning developers!

I am Marwin, a Full-Stack Developer, focussing on Frontend. I have worked as a coach for web development bootcamps at neuefische GmbH. I live in Cologne, Germany and work remotely. Ask me about Next.js, Framer Motion, CSS, SVGs and how to talk to your colleagues in the Design Team ;)
